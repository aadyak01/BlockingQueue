# BlockingQueue
Blocking Queue: Producer-Consumer Problem

# Single request processing blocking queue which is thread safe and has 1 producer and 5 consumers. DO NOT use standard or built-in Java/Python library packages. Implement your own blocking queue. Make sure to handle edge cases. Your submission should show how the processing from the extra consumers is blocked when the producer is producing at capacity.
